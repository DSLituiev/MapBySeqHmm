qualityCtrl.eps   -- quality control graphs: 
                      + coverage distribution
                      + SNP-ratio distribution
                      + coverage vs SNP-ratio scatter plot
                      + SNP spacing distribution

LogLiOdds.eps     -- log-likelihood odds:    log( L[+] / L[-] ) 
                      where L[+] is the likelihood that a locus is under 100% selection
                            L[-] is the likelihood that a locus is not under selection at all


SNP_Ratio_k[X].eps  -- SNP ratio ( raw and smoothed ) for all chromosomes;  [X] is kernel size of the smoothing filters (mean and median)

LH-Posterior.eps   -- likelihood and posterior for 100% selection hypothesis locus-wise. 
                      A red triangle (if present) indicates an candidate picked up earlier.

zMLE.eps           -- maximum likelihood estimation of number of mutant plants per locus in the studied population.
